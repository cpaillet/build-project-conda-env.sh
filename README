This script automate creation of Conda environments for Python projects.
It expects to be launched from the project's root directory,
and it expects it to contain a "requirements" directory with pip requirements
and Conda environment definitions.

Sample structure:

    requirements/
        pip/
            dev.txt
            prod.txt
        conda/
            dev.yml
            prod.yml

Usage:

    $ cd /path/to/project/root

    # Create a dev environment for the project
    # In this example, this will create a "root-dev" conda environment.
    $ /path/to/build-conda-project-env.sh

    # Create a prod environment for the project
    # In this example, this will create a "root-prod" conda environment.
    $ /path/to/build-conda-project-env.sh prod
